<p>
    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
    Smaug
    came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
    decided
    to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also
    believed
    that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious
    Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business,
    welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            Thorin II "Oakenshield", eventually called King under the Mountain or Mountain King[1], was the son of
            Thráin II, the
            older brother of Frerin and Dís, the grandson of King Thrór and the uncle of Fíli and Kíli. Thorin was best
            known for
            his deeds as leader of a company that infiltrated the lost Kingdom under the Mountain to take it back from
            Smaug and for
            leading an alliance of Men, Dwarves, and Elves in the Battle of Five Armies.

        <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews
            of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.
            As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching. It
            was they that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains.
            With the other Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking
            Thranduil. They escaped the cells thanks to Bilbo, traveling down the river in barrels until they reached
            Lake-town. The brothers accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to Lake-town while the others rested by the
            river.At the feet of the Lonely Mountain, Fíli and Kíli scouted Ravenhill and found the Front Gate with Balin and
            Bilbo. Also, with Bilbo, they found the side-door leading into the mountain.
            Both brothers were killed while defending the mortally wounded Thorin Oakenshield in the Battle of Five
            Armies, and all three were buried with honor.

        <h3>Oin</h3>
        <p>
            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak
            when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with
            Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves who
            bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in
            charge of preparing the fire for the Company. He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and later settled
            in the Lonely Mountain along with many other dwarves of The Company of Thorin.
